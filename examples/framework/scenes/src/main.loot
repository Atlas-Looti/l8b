// Main entry point
// Define routes: route(path, sceneName)
// - Static routes: route("/", "home")
// - Dynamic routes: route("/player/:id", "player") - :id becomes params.id

route("/", "home")
route("/battle", "battle")
route("/player/:id", "player")

// Initialize game (called once at startup)

  print("Game initialized")
  // Note: router.init() is called after all sources are loaded
  // So router.getPath() will be available in scene onEnter() hooks
